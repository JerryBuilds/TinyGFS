Instructions to run the program:1. Run Master.java to start Master2. Run ChunkServer.java 3 times to start 3 instances of chunk servers (Allow a couple seconds in between each instantiation)3. Run any UnitTest.NOTE:1. You need to start a new master and new chunk servers for each individual unit test. Our program is not able to run multiple unit tests with one master running. 2. The recovery feature is disabled. If master loads information from MasterLog.txt, it will cause unit tests failure. Directories and files cannot be created and not return success because it already exists in Masterâ€™s namespace tree. To enable recovery, uncomment the if statement block at line 75 to line 81 in com.master.Master.java. Also in com.master.Log line 36, change the second parameter of FileOutputStream Constructor to true to enable appending to MasterLog.txt.
